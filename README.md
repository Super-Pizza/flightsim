# Flight Simulator
This is a fun project (for now)

It's made entirely in Vulkan.

## Building
```bash
cargo build --release
```
If you want it smaller, install Nightly rust and run `./build.ps1` (should run on Linux and Windows natively)

## Plans
- Add debugging utilities (Vulkan validation layers, labels, scopes)
- Realistic physics
- Good graphics
- Multiple Models
- Good performance

### Non-Plans
- Ray-tracing

## Why?
For fun. I like aviation.
